### About Me

I specialised in Markov State models during my DPhil and branched out into Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming.

I was featured on the 2019 Makers/Computer Weekly [Women in Software Power List](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252462987/Winners-of-Makers-Women-in-Software-Powerlist-announced).

When I'm not doing maths, you can find me playing the piano, on a hike, or [blind wine tasting](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/zmjqp5/blind-wine-tasting-competition-oxbridge?fbclid=IwAR1-4Xs8tBvVC4fo6xXG6XZ1reZPn7IGEJYFdcW_gS-NvO_XsWsxDYD5CXQ).
